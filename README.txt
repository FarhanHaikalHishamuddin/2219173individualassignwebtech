I'm using document.getElementById('deductionForm').addEventListener('submit', function (event) {...} to register an event listener for the form with the ID deductionForm.
This event listener is triggered when the form is submitted.

2.Form Field Retrieval:

Inside the event listener, I retrieve the values of various form fields using document.getElementById.

3.Form Validation:

I perform basic form validation to ensure that crucial fields like name and amount are filled, and the deduction amount is greater than zero.
If the validation fails, an alert is shown, and event.preventDefault() is called to prevent the form from being submitted.

4.Success Handling:

If the form validation passes, proceed to hide the form and display a "Thank You" message.
This is achieved by adding and removing CSS classes:
document.getElementById('deductionForm').classList.add('hidden'); hides the form.
document.getElementById('thankYouMessage').classList.remove('hidden'); reveals the "Thank You" message.

5.Preventing Default Form Submission:

Regardless of success or failure in validation, event.preventDefault(); is called to prevent the default form submission behavior. This ensures that the form is not submitted in the traditional way, allowing to handle the submission via  JavaScript code.
